# JECE Assessment project

This project was created as part of my assessment for the web developer position at JECE Multilinks and it was built using HTML, ReactJs, CSS and react-icons

## Available Scripts

To view project locally, clone it and navigate to the directory, then run:

### `npm i`

to install all the node dependencies. Then finally run:

### `npm start`

to start the application locally.

## A live demo is also available on:

https://jece-skill-form.vercel.app/

Screenshots of various pages are availble in:

### './jece-skill-form/screenshots'

`A dark and light theme were presented in the material but the sample project had no theme switch toggle, hence I used CSS media to determine if the visitor's system setting is set to either light or dark mode to determin which version it would show.`
